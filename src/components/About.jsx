                    My name is Jared Tjahjadi. I am a senior undergraduate student from Queens, NY, currently studying Computer Science at Stony Brook University. My main coding languages are Java, JavaScript, and Python. I am currently looking for and would be interested in any part-time or full-time job opportunities or internships.

                    In my free time, I enjoy listening to pop, rock, or rap music, going to the gym, and taking walks. On campus, I am the President of the Pokemon GO Club and the Co-Head Activities Coordinator of the Science Fiction Forum!
